# Problem Statement:
Deaf and dumb individuals/students face significant challenges in traditional video calling platforms, as they heavily rely on visual cues & sign language for
communication.
Existing video calling solutions do not incorporate sign language recognition technology. As a result, deaf & dumb individuals are unable to fully express
themselves through sign language, limiting their ability to communicate naturally.

# Solution:
Our goal is to create a video calling website that provides an inclusive platform for deaf and dumb individuals.
The website will provide a video calling feature that supports real-time communication. Deaf users can communicate through sign language while hearing
users can speak. The video interface will be designed to accommodate both sign language gestures and spoken language. This will ensure that both deaf & hearing
participants can easily engage in conversation. The website will translate sign language into text, making it accessible to hearing individuals. Translated text
will be displayed alongside the video feed during video calls.

# Technology and Platform used:
1) Machine Learning
2) Computer Vision: Computer vision algorithms to process sign language gestures.
3) Web Development: Build a user-friendly website that facilitates video calling, web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development are used.
4) Data Preprocessing: Used libraries and frameworks like OpenCV & TensorFlow to preprocess.
5) Figma
